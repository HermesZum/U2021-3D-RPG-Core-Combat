## Description

**Role Playing Games can be complex to create, with many interacting gameplay systems. We make it easy for you!** 

Learn, step-by-step, how to make the foundations of any good RPG combat system - from scratch.

In this course we're focusing on the core of any great RPG, giving your players a fun **combat moment** in a well crafted level, based upon a solid game design, built using a robust code architecture. 

You will follow our project, but also make the game entirely your own.

We recommend you take at least the first half of our Complete Unity Developer 2D or 3D, or equivalent, as a pre-requisite.

This is a highly realistic and comprehensive introduction to real game development. 

We'll be taking you through our process step-by-step, with all decisions justified and all avenues explored.

We will be dealing with player movement, NavMesh navigation, AI pathfinding, save and loading systems, basic pick ups, using asset packs, debug code, making particle effects and more. 

We'll also give you a robust code architecture for managing more complex projects by setting up namespaces.

You'll need a basic grasp of Unity and C# before you get start, from there we'll be teaching you more advanced programming techniques such as C# delegates, interfaces, co-routines and more.

Building an RPG is an amazing way to level-up your game development skills, so why not join us and get started improving your game development right now?
